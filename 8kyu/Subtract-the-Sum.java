// NOTE! This kata can be more difficult than regular 8-kyu katas (lets say 7 or 6 kyu)
// Complete the function which get an input number n such that n >= 10 and n < 10000, then:

// Sum all the digits of n.
// Subtract the sum from n, and it is your new n.
// If the new n is in the list below return the associated fruit, otherwise return back to task 1.

// .
// .
// .
// ...until you find the first n in the list below.

// There is no preloaded code to help you. This is not about coding skills; think before you code

// My solution 
public class Kata {
  public static String subtractSum (int n) {
    return "apple";
  }
}

// code was a trick assignment
